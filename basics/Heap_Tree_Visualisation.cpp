// Heaps Visualisation (Binary Tree)

// In min heap parents are lower and the siblings are greater than 
// the parents. I think it should be in complete tree.
                For Min Heap
                     4
              20             30
        50        60     70       40

// If the order is not matching then make a swap and do it. But tree should 
// be in complete tree.


// In max heap parents are higher and siblings are lower than the parents.
// In MaxHeap tree, Node's below is lesser than the parent.

In tree , for a node at i,then,

left child=2*i 
right child=2*i+1
Parents=i/2
